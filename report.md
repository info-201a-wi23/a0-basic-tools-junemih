## Data Viz Summary
![alt text](graph.jpg)

This graph provides a visual representation of the disparity when it comes to line distribution between genders in cinema. Men speak more often than women in the majority of films- about 15% of the movies in this study had men speak over 90% of the lines, and about 60% of the films in this study had men speak in between 60-90% of the lines. In all genres recorded, men spoke the majority of the lines. In all decades recorded, men spoke the majority of the lines. This disparity reflects the power difference not only within Hollywood but also within most discussions in real life- whether it be within homes, social outings, or workplaces: these conversations are more often than not dominated by men. What this graph does is it provides the public with real hard, undeniable data, which can help lead to informed discussion and change in the future.

‚ÄúData feminism requires us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting and classification that perpetuate oppression.‚Äù (D‚ÄôIgnazio, 2020)
